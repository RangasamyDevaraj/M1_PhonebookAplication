Introduction


    The phonebook application works specifically for tracking people. The Phonebook application contains a set of basic functions for adding, searching, updating, and deleting new contacts. This mini-C phonebook design allows you to perform simple tasks in your phonebook, such as mobile phones. You can add text to the phonebook, find, edit, search, and delete. The concept of file management and data structure is often used in almost all functions in this project.
